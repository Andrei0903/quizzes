# Programmer's day

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)]()

this project was created for the class hour of the group ╠ ISP-11.19.2 ╣


## Small documentation 
Mostly will be.
  - How to open it ?
- What to do ?
- what for ?

# Web version !
How to open: Well, everything is simple, open a file index.html
  - - The project follows the BEM rule. The code is easy to read!
  - - There are a lot of unnecessary comments and I Packed it specifically so as not to open it too much.

What to do:
- different tasks and questions at each stage.
  - We need to solve as much as possible and as best as possible.
